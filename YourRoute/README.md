Overview
YourRoute is a dynamic web application that allows users to visualize and track public transportation vehicles in real-time on an interactive map. Beyond simple tracking, it integrates an AI agent to provide highly accurate estimated arrival times and intelligent route suggestions, adapting to live traffic and transit conditions. Initially developed with dummy data, the project now utilizes real-time APIs to offer genuine, up-to-the-minute information, starting with Delhi's transit network.

The goal is to empower commuters with precise, actionable information, reducing wait times and improving overall travel predictability.

Key Features
Live Map Visualization: View the real-time positions of buses and metros on a detailed map, centered on the user's city (currently Delhi).

Real-time Data Integration: Connects directly with live public transit APIs to fetch authentic, up-to-the-minute vehicle locations and status updates.

AI-Powered Predictive ETAs: An integrated AI agent analyzes real-time data, historical patterns, traffic conditions, and other factors to provide highly accurate estimated arrival times for buses and metros at specific stops.

Dynamic Route Optimization: The AI agent can suggest alternative routes or transit options in real-time if delays or disruptions are detected on a user's planned journey, optimizing for efficiency.

Comprehensive Stop Information: Hovering over a bus or metro stop marker displays the stop name, along with the AI-predicted estimated arrival time of the next relevant vehicle.

Responsive Design: Built with React and Material UI, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Customizable & Extensible: The modular codebase is designed for easy integration of additional real-time APIs, expansion to new cities, and support for diverse transit types.

How It Works
Data Ingestion: The application continuously fetches real-time public transportation data (vehicle locations, speeds, route information, incident reports) from dedicated transit APIs.

AI Processing & Prediction:

This raw real-time data is fed into a backend system.

An AI agent (powered by machine learning models) processes this data alongside historical transit patterns, traffic data, and external factors (like weather).

The AI generates highly accurate estimated arrival times (ETAs) for vehicles at upcoming stops.

It also continuously monitors for disruptions and identifies optimal alternative routes.

Map Display: The Google Maps JavaScript API renders an interactive map.

Intelligent Markers:

Bus/Metro Markers: Display the current real-time location and fleet name, dynamically updated on the map.

Stop Markers: Show the stop name and, crucially, the AI-predicted next arrival time via an informative tooltip on hover.

User Interaction: Users can pan, zoom, and interact with the map to explore transit options, view detailed stop information, and receive intelligent route suggestions.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

React: A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Material UI: A popular React UI framework implementing Google's Material Design.

Google Maps JavaScript API: For embedding and customizing maps in web applications.

Backend & AI (Conceptual):

Real-time Transit APIs: (Specific APIs would depend on the city/region, e.g., GTFS-Realtime feeds).

Backend Framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Flask/Django): To handle API integrations, data processing, and serve AI predictions.

Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn): For building and training AI models for ETA prediction and route optimization.

Database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL): For storing historical transit data and potentially user preferences.

Setup & Installation
To get YourRoute up and running locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm or Yarn

A Google Maps JavaScript API Key (with Maps JavaScript API enabled)

Access to a real-time public transit API (e.g., a GTFS-Realtime feed for Delhi).

Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/yourroute.git
cd yourroute

Install frontend dependencies:

npm install # or yarn install

Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root of the project (or wherever your frontend expects it) and add your API keys:

REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
REACT_APP_TRANSIT_API_BASE_URL=YOUR_TRANSIT_API_BASE_URL
# Add any other API keys or configuration needed for your backend/AI services

Note: For the backend/AI components, you'll need separate environment configurations.

Run the Frontend Application:

npm start # or yarn start

This will typically open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Backend/AI Setup (Conceptual):

Set up your backend server (if separate) to consume the real-time transit API data.

Implement and deploy your AI models for predictions.

Ensure your frontend can communicate with your backend to receive the AI-enhanced data. (Specific instructions will vary greatly depending on your chosen backend technologies).

Future Enhancements
The YourRoute project is designed for continuous improvement. Here are some key areas for future development:

User Authentication & Personalization: Allow users to create accounts, save favorite routes, set home/work locations, and receive personalized transit recommendations.

Advanced Notifications: Implement push notifications for real-time alerts on bus/metro arrivals, delays, or suggested reroutes.

Multi-City & Multi-Modal Support: Expand the application to cover more cities and integrate data from various public transportation modes (e.g., trams, ferries, local trains).

Crowdsourced Data Integration: Allow users to report issues (e.g., overcrowding, unexpected delays) to further enhance real-time accuracy and community awareness.

Predictive Congestion Mapping: Use AI to predict and visualize areas of potential congestion on transit routes.

Voice Assistant Integration: Enable voice commands for querying transit information.

Accessibility Features: Enhance features for users with disabilities, such as audio announcements or optimized routes for wheelchair access.
